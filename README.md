# Exercism Go Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the Go track exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/). Each exercise is organized in its own folder with the corresponding solution files.

Each folder contains:
- `main.go`: My solution for the specific exercise.
- `main_test.go`: Test cases provided by Exercism to verify the solution.

## How to Run
